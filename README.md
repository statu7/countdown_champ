Tutorial React.js app for better undestanding following concepts. 

## React Components
- re-usable and independent pieces of React code that comprise the User Interface.

## ES6 importing and exporting
- a new syntax for sharing code between separate files. Used in cases like `import React from ‘react’`

## State
- the pertinent data to an application. Each component has its local state as long as you declare add the constructor to a Component and declare its state object.

## Updating State
- When updating state, make sure to never mutate state directly. Doing so will lead to fatal errors in your application. Instead, re-declare new instances of state arrays or objects and use the setState() function to update state.

## Props
- similar to state, except this data inherits from parent component specifying pieces of state as properties.

LifeCycle Methods - events in React components that trigger in cases such as rendering on or off the screen, or during state updates. One example is the `componentDidMount()` lifeCycle hook.
